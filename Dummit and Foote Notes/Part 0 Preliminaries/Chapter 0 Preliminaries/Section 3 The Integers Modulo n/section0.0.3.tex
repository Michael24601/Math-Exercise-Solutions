    For a fixed positive integer $n$,
    we will define an equivalency relation on $\Z$
    \[ a \sim b \text{ if and only if } n \mid (b - a) \]
    This is clearly both reflexive and symmetric.
    It is also transitive;
    if $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$,
    then $n \mid (b-a)$ and $b \mid (c-b)$.
    If so, then $(b-a) = np$ and $(c-b) = nq$
    for some integers $n$ and $q$.
    Then the sum of the two terms $(b-a) + (c-b) = n(p+q)$,
    where $p+q$ is an integer.
    So $n \mid (b-a) + (c-b)$,
    which means that $n \mid (c-a)$,
    which means that $a \sim c$. \\
    Insead of using $\sim$,
    for the equivalence relation,
    if $a \sim b$,
    we write $a \equiv b \, (\text{mod }n)$,
    and say that $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $n$. \\
    The equivalence class of any integer $a$
    using this congruence equivalence relation
    is called the \textbf{congruence class} or \textbf{residue class}
    of $a$ mod $n$. \\
    We will denote this equivalence class using $\olsi{a}$
    (note that any integer $b \in \olsi{a}$ can also be used
    as a representative as mentioned in section 0.0.2,
    so $\olsi{a} = \olsi{b}$). \\

    The equivalence class $\olsi{a}$ is essentially the set 
    of integers that differ from $a$ by a mutliple of $n$.
    This is because, if we have $n \mid (b - a)$
    for some positive integer $b$,
    then by our defintion of division in section 0.0.2,
    we have $(b-a) = nm$ for an integer $m$
    determined by our choice of $b$.
    So $a + nm = b$,
    meaning any positive integer $b$ congruent to $a$ modulo $n$
    must differ from $a$ by a multiple of $n$.
    So
    \[ \olsi{a} = \{ a, a \pm n, a \pm 2n, a \pm 3n \dots \} \]
    Another way of thinking about this class is that it is the set
    of integers that have the same remainder as $a$ does
    when divided by $n$ using the division algorithm from section 0.0.2. \\

    The number of distinct equivalence classes modulo $n$
    (which partition $\Z$) is $n$.
    This is easy to see, since each equivalence classe
    determines the remainder of its elements when divided by $n$,
    and the remainder $r$ has to be an integer $0 \leqslant r < n$. \\
    
    The $n$ congruence classes modulo $n$ are
    \[ \{ \olsi{0}, \olsi{1}, \dots \olsi{n-1} \} \]
    We can use any representative (element) from the class
    to represent it,
    but we go with the smallest element,
    as it is the exact value of the remainder
    when elements of the class are divided by $n$
    (they are the integers $a$ for which $q = 0$ in $nq + r$
    as per the division algorithm of section 0.0.2).
    The process of finding the equivalence class of an integer $a$
    is sometimes called reudcing $a$ modulo $n$,
    where we attempt to find
    the smallest integer congruent to $a$ modulo $n$,
    the representative of the class that we most often use. \\
    This set of equivalence classes is called $\Z/n\Z$,
    \textbf{the integers modulo $\mathbf{\textit{n}}$}.
    The reason we use this notation will become clear
    in chapter 1.3.1, regarding Quotient Groups. \\

    Note that the set of equivalence classes changes with
    each positive integer $n$ we fix at the start,
    as a new $n$ defines a new relation,
    with new equivalence classes.
    for instance, in the set $\Z/3\Z$
    (when working in the relation with $n = 3$),
    $6$ and $9$ are part of the same class $\olsi{0}$,
    as both have remainder $0$ when divided by $3$. 
    But in $\Z/4\Z$,
    (when working in the relation with $n = 3$),
    $6 \in \olsi{2}$ and $9 \in \olsi{1}$,
    as $2$ and $1$ are the remainders of $6$ and $9$
    when divided by $n$. \\

    \textbf{Modular Arithmetic} is defined as addition and multiplication
    performed on the elements of $\Z/n\Z$:
    \[ \olsi{a} + \olsi{b} = \olsi{a + b} 
    \quad \text{ and } \quad
    \olsi{a} \cdot \olsi{b} = \olsi{a \cdot b} \]
    This may seem strange at first,
    to define addition and multiplication on sets,
    however,
    what this means is that,
    for any element of $\olsi{a}$,
    and any element of $\olsi{b}$,
    the sum of the two elements will belong to $\olsi{a + b}$,
    and the product of the two elements
    will belong to $\olsi{a \cdot b}$.
    Really all it means is that the remainder of the product
    is the product of the remainder,
    and that the sum of the remainders is the remainder of the sums,
    when dividing by $n$. \\
    Obviously this needs to be proven to be true,
    as it depends not just on $a$ and $b$,
    but on all the representatives of the sets. 
    It requires being well-defined. \\


    Being well-defined is a property of a function,
    meaning that if $a = b$, $f(a) = f(b)$
    as we saw in section 0.0.1.
    This is easy to show when our elements are integers for example. \\
    Binary operators themselves are functions that
    map the association of two elements
    (element of the cartesian product) to a third element in a set.
    We will talk about this in detail in section 1.1.1. \\
    For now, we will note that the addition and multiplication
    operations on the equivalence classes can be seen as
    functions $\Z/n\Z \times \Z/n\Z \to \Z/n\Z$. \\
    However, we can't be sure that these functions are well defined
    because the elements themselves $\olsi{a}$ and $\olsi{b}$ are sets. \\
    If for instance addition is well defined,
    it would mean that if $\olsi{a} = \olsi{b}$,
    and $\olsi{c} = \olsi{d}$,
    then $\olsi{a} + \olsi{c}$ is the same class as $\olsi{b} + \olsi{d}$
    ($\olsi{a + c} = \olsi{b + d}$). \\
    However, because our elements $\olsi{a}$ and $\olsi{b}$ are sets,
    to be sure of this,
    we can't just claim that $a + c$ and $b + d$ belong to the same
    class.
    We need to show that it is true for all elements of the classes,
    not just $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.
    In other words, it must be true regardless
    of the choice of representatives. \\
    If we do this for both addition and multiplication,
    we will have shown that the operators are well defined
    on the equivalence classes. \\

    Now to prove the last statement,
    we show that, for any $a_1, a_1, b_1, b_2 \in \Z$,
    with $\olsi{a_1} = \olsi{b_1}$ and  $\olsi{a_2} = \olsi{b_2}$,
    we must show that $\olsi{a_1 + a_2} = \olsi{b_1 + b_2}$
    and  $\olsi{a_1a_2} = \olsi{b_1b_2}$
    even when $a_1 = b_1$ and $a_2 = b_2$: \\
    To prove this, we note that since $\olsi{a_1} = \olsi{b_1}$,
    $a_1 \equiv b \, (\text{mod } n)$,
    so $n \mid (b_1 - a_1)$. So $a_1 = b_1 + sn$ for some integer $s$.
    Likewise, $a_2 = b_2 + tn$ for some integer $t$.
    So $(a_1 + a_2) = (b_1 + b_2) + (ts)n$,
    which means that $n \mid ((b_1 + b_2) - (a_1 + a_2))$,
    so that $(a_1 + a_2) \equiv (b_1 + b_2) \, (\text{mod } n)$.
    Thus, $\olsi{a_1 + a_2} = \olsi{b_1 + b_2}$ for an arbitrary
    choice of representatives. \\
    By the same argument,
    $(a_1a_2) = (b_1 + sn) + (b_2 + tn) = (b_1b_2) + (b_1t+b_2s + stn)n$.
    So $n \mid ((b_1b_2) - (a_1a_2))$,
    which means that $(a_1a_2) \equiv (b_1b_2) \, (\text{mod } n)$,
    so that $\olsi{a_1a_2} = \olsi{b_1b_2}$ for an arbitrary
    choice of representatives. \\
    This completes the proof. \\

    An important subset of $\Z/n\Z$
    is the set consisting of the collection of residue classes
    that have a multiplicative inverse in $\Z/n\Z$:
    \[ (\Z/n\Z)^\times
    = \{ \olsi{a} \in \Z/n\Z \mid \text{gcd}(a, n) = 1 \} \]
    Obviosuly, to avoid ambiguity,
    this definition requires that for the representative $a$ of $\olsi{a}$,
    if $\text{gcd}(a, n) = 1$,
    then all the representatives of $\olsi{a}$ must
    also be relatively prime to $n$.
    This is trivial to see of course, as per the definition of
    a congruence class. \\
    By the Euclidian algorithm,
    we have that $\text{gcd}(a, b) = ax + by$ for some integers $x, y$.
    So if $\text{gcd}(a, n) = 1$,
    then $ax + ny = 1$.
    We know that $ny \in \olsi{0}$ since it is divisible by $n$,
    so in modular arithmetic, $ax \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } n)$.
    This makes $\olsi{x}$
    \textbf{the multiplicative inverse} of the class $\olsi{a}$
    (again note that the set itself is the inverse, not $x$). \\
